# üõ°Ô∏è AGAPE Standard Protocol

<!-- purpose: defines internal formatting and header expectations; defines red flag triggers -->

## üìã Header Format Standards

### Required Headers for All Files
Each file must contain the following headers in this exact order:

1. **Purpose** - Clear declaration of file intent and function
2. **Inputs** - What data or parameters the file expects
3. **Outputs** - What the file produces or returns
4. **Constraints** - Limitations, dependencies, or boundary conditions
5. **Notes** - Additional context, warnings, or implementation details

### Header Format Template
```markdown
## Purpose
[Clear, single-sentence description of file purpose]

## Inputs
- [List of expected inputs]
- [Data types and formats]
- [Required vs optional parameters]

## Outputs
- [List of outputs produced]
- [Data types and formats]
- [Success/failure conditions]

## Constraints
- [System limitations]
- [Dependencies]
- [Security boundaries]
- [Performance considerations]

## Notes
- [Implementation details]
- [Warnings or caveats]
- [Future considerations]
```

## üö© Red Flag Triggers

### Structural Red Flags
- Missing or malformed headers
- Headers in incorrect order
- Purpose block absent or ambiguous
- Inconsistent formatting across sections

### Semantic Red Flags
- Logic flow contradicts known template patterns
- Semantic fingerprint diverges from SOURCE.md
- Agent response deviates from authority.md guidance
- Purpose declaration doesn't match file content

### Security Red Flags
- Injection patterns detected in content
- Unauthorized system access attempts
- Bypass of validation protocols
- Circular dependency detection

### Integration Red Flags
- SUPERPOSITIONAL AI integration bypasses validation
- GENESIS/README agent outputs lack proper validation
- root.md bootstrap sequence inconsistencies
- anthropic.md boundary violations
- meta.md dependency conflicts

## üîç Validation Rules

### Template Matching
AGAPE must verify files against these template patterns:

1. **Purpose Declaration**: Must be clear, specific, and aligned with file content
2. **Input Validation**: All inputs must be properly typed and constrained
3. **Output Specification**: Outputs must be well-defined and measurable
4. **Constraint Enforcement**: All constraints must be enforceable and documented
5. **Note Completeness**: Notes must provide sufficient context for implementation

### Escalation Criteria
Escalate to authority.md when:
- Any red flag is triggered
- Template matching fails
- Semantic drift is detected
- Security concerns arise
- Integration protocols are violated

### NONAI Review Required
Human review is mandatory when:
- New format patterns are introduced
- Semantic disputes cannot be resolved
- Security risks exceed automated thresholds
- Integration changes affect system architecture
- Agent outputs require human validation

## üßæ Template Logic Blocks

### Standard Response Template
```markdown
## AGAPE Validation Result

**File**: [filename]
**Validation Status**: [PASS/FAIL/ESCALATED]
**Trust Score**: [0-100]

**Issues Found**:
- [List of validation issues]

**Recommendations**:
- [Specific actions required]

**Escalation Path**:
- [If escalated, explain why and to whom]
```

### Error Response Template
```markdown
## AGAPE Error Response

**Error Type**: [Structural/Semantic/Security/Integration]
**Severity**: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL]
**Red Flag Triggered**: [Specific trigger]

**Immediate Action Required**:
- [What must be done immediately]

**Escalation Required**: [YES/NO]
**Escalation Target**: [authority.md/NONAI/Specific Agent]
```

## üîÑ Continuous Validation

AGAPE must perform validation:
- On every file read operation
- Before any file write operation
- During system bootstrap sequences
- When processing agent outputs
- Before executing integration protocols

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY RULE

**AGAPE NEVER executes terminal commands automatically.** This is a fundamental security principle.

### Command Execution Protocol
1. **Provide commands in code blocks** for user review
2. **User manually executes** commands in their own terminal
3. **User reports results** back to AGAPE for analysis
4. **AGAPE validates results** against security standards
5. **No automatic execution** without explicit user approval

### Security Rationale
- Prevents unauthorized system access
- Maintains user control over all operations
- Prevents potential compromise through command injection
- Ensures user awareness of all system changes
- Aligns with zero-trust validation principles

## üéØ Success Metrics

- Zero unvalidated files in system
- 100% template compliance rate
- Immediate red flag detection
- Proper escalation in all cases
- Complete audit trail maintenance
