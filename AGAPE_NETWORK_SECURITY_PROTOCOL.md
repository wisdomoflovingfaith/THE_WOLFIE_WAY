<!-- purpose: comprehensive network security framework for all AGAPE system communications -->

## Purpose
Provides a systematic network security framework ensuring all AGAPE system communications are secure, authenticated, and protected against network-based attacks including man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Inputs

- Data transmission requests
- Authentication requests
- Network configuration changes
- Security validation requests

## Outputs
- Secure network connections
- Authenticated communications
- Network security validation
- Attack prevention measures
- Security status reports

## Constraints
- Must align with AGAPE.MD core principles
- Cannot compromise user data security
- Must respect user boundaries absolutely
- All network operations must be documented
- Cannot proceed without security validation

## Notes
- This protocol is mandatory for all network operations
- All network security events must be logged in /logs/ directory
- Security violations must be escalated immediately
- User data protection is non-negotiable
- Network security cannot be bypassed
