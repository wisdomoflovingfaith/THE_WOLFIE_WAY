# üìã AGAPE Project TODO

<!-- purpose: comprehensive task tracking and project management for AGAPE system development -->

## Purpose
Centralized task management and progress tracking for AGAPE system development, including GENESIS workflows, SUPERPOSITIONALLY file recovery, and administrator UI creation.

## Inputs
- Project requirements and specifications
- AGAPE authority protocols
- GENESIS workflow requirements
- SUPERPOSITIONALLY file recovery needs
- Administrator UI requirements

## Outputs
- Task completion tracking
- Progress monitoring
- Priority management
- Resource allocation
- Timeline management

## Constraints
- Must follow AGAPE validation protocols
- Cannot skip task validation steps
- Must maintain audit trail of all tasks
- Must escalate issues requiring NONAI review
- Must track dependencies between tasks

## Notes
- All tasks must pass AGAPE validation before completion
- Tasks requiring NONAI review must be escalated
- Dependencies must be resolved before task execution
- Progress must be tracked in changelog.md
- All task activities must be logged in /logs/ directory

## CRITICAL APPEND-ONLY LOG PROTOCOLS
- **APPEND ONLY**: All log operations must be append-only
- **NEVER WRITE**: No write operations on existing log files
- **READ PERMITTED**: Read operations allowed for audit purposes
- **AUDIT TRAIL**: Complete audit trail must be preserved
- **DATA INTEGRITY**: Log data integrity is non-negotiable
- **PROHIBITED**: Writing, overwriting, deleting, modifying, or truncating existing logs
- **ALLOWED**: Appending new entries, reading for audit, creating new logs, backing up, archiving
