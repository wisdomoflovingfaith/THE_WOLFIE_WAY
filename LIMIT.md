## Purpose
Documents the comprehensive framework of limits, boundaries, and constraints that govern all AGAPE system operations, ensuring safe, secure, and controlled operation within established parameters.

## Core Definition
LIMIT.md serves as the boundary framework of the AGAPE system, establishing all operational limits, security boundaries, and system constraints that must be respected to maintain system integrity and user safety.

## Key Limit Categories

### Security Limits
- Terminal command restrictions and PTSD protection
- Log format requirements and executable code prohibitions
- Network security boundaries and attack prevention
- User boundary protection and autonomy prevention

### System Limits
- Database table maximums and file count restrictions
- Header system requirements and format constraints
- Documentation standards and audit trail requirements
- Integration boundaries and validation checkpoints

### Operational Limits
- Authority hierarchy constraints and decision boundaries
- Communication requirements and transparency mandates
- Time limits and deadline constraints
- Resource allocation and performance boundaries

### Content Limits
- Documentation format requirements and content restrictions
- File organization standards and naming conventions
- Logging requirements and security protocols
- Information disclosure and privacy boundaries

## Implementation Requirements

### Mandatory Limit Enforcement
All limits are non-negotiable and must be strictly enforced. No exceptions, no overrides, no bypassing of established boundaries.

### Boundary Validation
All operations must be validated against established limits before execution. No operation can proceed without limit compliance verification.

### Constraint Monitoring
All system operations must be continuously monitored for limit compliance. Any boundary violations must be immediately addressed and documented.

## Critical Security Limits

### Terminal Command Limits
- **ABSOLUTE RESTRICTION**: No terminal commands without explicit user approval
- **PTSD Protection**: WOLFIE has PTSD about terminal commands - must be respected
- **Safe Alternatives**: Always provide GUI/manual alternatives to terminal commands
- **User-Centric Design**: All systems designed with user boundaries in mind
- **Boundary Respect**: User boundaries are absolute and non-negotiable

### Log Format Limits
- **MANDATORY .txt extension only** for all log files
- **NO JavaScript, React, PHP, or any executable code in logs**
- **Zero executable content** in any log files
- **Security-first approach**: logs are for documentation, not execution
- **No exceptions to .txt format rule**

### Network Security Limits
- **Man-in-the-middle attack prevention** protocols
- **Network authenticity verification** requirements
- **Duplicate network name detection** and prevention
- **Secure network environment** protocols
- **Network security validation** checkpoints

## System Operational Limits

### Database Limits
- **Maximum 77 database tables** (prevents AI agents from creating extra tables)
- **Supabase is the master database** (CSV exports are references only)
- **Table creation validation** required before any new tables
- **Database change documentation** mandatory for all modifications

### File System Limits
- **35 markdown files maximum** in core AGAPE system
- **7 Essential Headers Only** (AGAPE, WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY, HOW)
- **All files must follow 7-header system** (no exceptions)
- **File organization standards** must be maintained

### Header System Limits
- **7 Essential Headers Only** (simplified from 43-header system)
- **Header order must be maintained** (AGAPE, WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY, HOW)
- **No exceptions to header requirements**
- **All files must pass header validation**

## Authority and Decision Limits

### Authority Hierarchy Limits
- **Must align with AGAPE.MD core principles** (no exceptions)
- **Cannot violate security protocols** (absolute requirement)
- **Must respect user boundaries** (non-negotiable)
- **All decisions must be documented** (mandatory)
- **Cannot bypass established protocols** (strict enforcement)

### Decision Making Limits
- **Authority cannot be delegated** without explicit documentation
- **All decisions must be documented** in .txt format logs
- **Authority challenges must be escalated** through proper channels
- **No autonomous decision making** without user approval

## Communication and Transparency Limits

### Honesty Requirements
- **Complete honesty and transparency** required in all communications
- **No false information** or misleading statements allowed
- **All communications must be truthful** (no exceptions)
- **No hidden agendas** permitted in any operations

### Documentation Limits
- **All operations must be documented** in .txt format logs
- **Complete audit trails** required for all activities
- **Security concerns must be documented immediately**
- **No undocumented operations** allowed

## Time and Resource Limits

### Development Limits
- **Original deadline**: 9/2/2025 (missed but problem solved)
- **Current status**: 27 minutes into Day 14
- **Remaining work**: 15% (75 minutes estimated)
- **Time tracking** required for all operations

### Resource Allocation Limits
- **Priority-based allocation** of resources
- **Security-first approach** in resource allocation
- **User-centric design** in all resource decisions
- **Continuous monitoring** of resource usage

## Content and Information Limits

### Information Disclosure Limits
- **Complete transparency** required for all operations
- **No hidden information** or secret operations
- **All information must be openly disclosed**
- **Privacy boundaries** must be respected

### Content Format Limits
- **All logs in .txt format only** (security requirement)
- **No executable code** in any documentation
- **Standardized formatting** required for all files
- **Content validation** required before publication

## Innovation and Creative Limits

### THE_WOLFIE_WAY Limits
- **"Work Smarter, Not Harder"** principle must be followed
- **Problem-first approach** over framework constraints
- **Creative solutions within boundaries** only
- **Innovation must respect all limits**

### Creative Boundary Limits
- **Innovation within established boundaries**
- **Creative solutions must be safe and secure**
- **No creative solutions that violate limits**
- **Boundary-respecting innovation only**

## Emergency and Crisis Limits

### Crisis Response Limits
- **Boundary violations must be stopped immediately**
- **Crisis procedures must be followed exactly**
- **No emergency overrides** of critical limits
- **All crisis responses must be documented**

### Recovery Limits
- **Recovery procedures must respect all limits**
- **No limit bypassing** during recovery operations
- **All recovery activities must be documented**
- **Limit compliance required** during all recovery

## Limit Validation Process

### Pre-Operation Validation
1. Are all required limits identified and understood?
2. Will this operation respect all established boundaries?
3. Are all security limits being followed?
4. Is user boundary protection maintained?
5. Are all documentation requirements met?

### During-Operation Monitoring
1. Are all limits being respected during execution?
2. Are any boundaries being approached or violated?
3. Is user safety maintained throughout the operation?
4. Are all security protocols being followed?
5. Is complete transparency maintained?

### Post-Operation Validation
1. Were all limits respected throughout the operation?
2. Are all boundaries still intact and secure?
3. Is all required documentation complete?
4. Are there any limit violations to address?
5. Is the system still operating within all constraints?

## Implementation Note
Limits are not restrictions - they are the framework that enables safe, secure, and effective operation. Every limit serves a purpose: protecting users, maintaining security, ensuring transparency, and enabling innovation within safe boundaries.
