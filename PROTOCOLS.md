# üìã AGAPE PROTOCOLS - General Protocol Framework

<!-- purpose: comprehensive general protocol framework for AGAPE system operations -->

## üéØ **PROTOCOL OVERVIEW**

### **Mission Statement**
AGAPE_PROTOCOLS defines the comprehensive general protocol framework for all AGAPE system operations, ensuring safe, secure, and compliant system behavior across all components and interactions.

### **Core Philosophy**
**"Protocols first, safety always"** - Every operation follows established protocols to ensure system security, user protection, and operational excellence.

## üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY-FIRST PROTOCOLS**
