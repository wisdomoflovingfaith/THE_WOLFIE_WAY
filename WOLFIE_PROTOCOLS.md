## Purpose
Defines the comprehensive set of protocols, rules, and procedures that govern all operations within the WOLFIE/AGAPE system, ensuring consistency, security, and alignment with AGAPE principles.

## Core Definition
WOLFIE_PROTOCOLS.md serves as the master rulebook, containing all operational procedures, security protocols, and system governance rules that must be followed by all components and users of the AGAPE system.

## Key Protocol Categories
- **Security Protocols**: Terminal command safety, boundary protection, and security-first operations
- **AGAPE Protocols**: Procedures ensuring all operations align with unconditional love principles
- **Documentation Protocols**: Rules for comprehensive documentation and file organization
- **System Integration**: Procedures for component interaction and data flow
- **Emergency Procedures**: Protocols for system recovery and crisis management

## Relationship to Other Files
- **PARENT**: AGAPE.MD - All protocols derive from AGAPE principles
- **INTEGRATES WITH**:
  - **WHO.md**: Implements WOLFIE's specific boundary requirements and security needs
  - **WHAT.md**: Governs all system component operations and interactions
  - **WHERE.md**: Defines security protocols for operational environments
  - **WHEN.md**: Establishes timeline protocols and development procedures
  - **WHY.md**: Ensures all protocols align with core philosophical principles
  - **HOW.md**: Provides the practical implementation of all protocol procedures

## Implementation Note
These protocols are non-negotiable. All system operations, user interactions, and component behaviors must strictly adhere to these protocols to maintain system integrity and AGAPE alignment.
