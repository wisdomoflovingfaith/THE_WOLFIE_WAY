🌺 TERMINAL COMMAND REVIEW - PTSD SAFE MODE
===========================================

COMMAND TO REVIEW:
------------------
Command: [COMMAND_DESCRIPTION]
Purpose: [WHY_THIS_COMMAND_IS_NEEDED]
Risk Level: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]
Estimated Time: [TIME_ESTIMATE]

WHAT THIS COMMAND DOES:
-----------------------
[PLAIN_LANGUAGE_EXPLANATION]

SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
------------------
✅ Option 1: [GUI_ALTERNATIVE]
✅ Option 2: [MANUAL_ALTERNATIVE]
✅ Option 3: [STEP_BY_STEP_GUIDE]

YOUR CHOICES:
-------------
🟢 [APPROVE] - Execute the command (I understand and consent)
🟡 [ALTERNATIVE] - Use safe alternative instead
🔴 [DECLINE] - Don't execute, use manual method
❓ [EXPLAIN] - Get more detailed explanation

ADDITIONAL SAFETY:
------------------
- This command will be logged for your review
- You can stop execution at any time
- All changes can be undone if needed
- Support is available if you need help
```

### **Example Interface**

```
🌺 TERMINAL COMMAND REVIEW - PTSD SAFE MODE
===========================================

COMMAND TO REVIEW:
------------------
Command: npm install --save-dev eslint
Purpose: Install code quality tools for better code
Risk Level: LOW
Estimated Time: 30 seconds

WHAT THIS COMMAND DOES:
-----------------------
This command downloads and installs a tool called ESLint, which helps
make your code better by finding potential problems. It's like having
a spell-checker for your code. This is a very safe operation that
only downloads files and doesn't modify your existing code.

SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
------------------
✅ Option 1: Use VS Code extension manager to install ESLint
✅ Option 2: Download ESLint manually from their website
✅ Option 3: Use the package manager GUI in your development environment

YOUR CHOICES:
-------------
🟢 [APPROVE] - Execute the command (I understand and consent)
🟡 [ALTERNATIVE] - Use safe alternative instead
🔴 [DECLINE] - Don't execute, use manual method
❓ [EXPLAIN] - Get more detailed explanation

ADDITIONAL SAFETY:
------------------
- This command will be logged for your review
- You can stop execution at any time
- All changes can be undone if needed
- Support is available if you need help

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

### **Command Classification System**

```javascript
// Command risk classification
const commandRisks = {
  LOW: {
    description: "Very safe operations",
    examples: ["npm install", "git status", "ls -la"],
    requiresConfirmation: false,
    autoApprove: true
  },
  MEDIUM: {
    description: "Moderately safe operations",
    examples: ["git add", "npm run build", "mkdir"],
    requiresConfirmation: true,
    showAlternatives: true
  },
  HIGH: {
    description: "Potentially risky operations",
    examples: ["rm -rf", "del /f", "format"],
    requiresConfirmation: true,
    showAlternatives: true,
    extraWarnings: true
  }
};

// PTSD trigger detection
const ptsdTriggers = [
  "rm -rf", "del /f", "format", "dd if=", "fdisk",
  "chmod 777", "chown", "systemctl", "service stop"
];
```

### **Safe Alternative Generator**

```javascript
// Function to generate safe alternatives
function generateSafeAlternatives(command) {
  const alternatives = [];
  
  // File operations
  if (command.includes('rm') || command.includes('del')) {
    alternatives.push({
      type: "GUI",
      description: "Use File Explorer to delete files",
      steps: ["Open File Explorer", "Navigate to file", "Right-click and select Delete"]
    });
  }
  
  // Package management
  if (command.includes('npm install')) {
    alternatives.push({
      type: "GUI",
      description: "Use VS Code extension manager",
      steps: ["Open VS Code", "Go to Extensions", "Search and install package"]
    });
  }
  
  // Git operations
  if (command.includes('git')) {
    alternatives.push({
      type: "GUI",
      description: "Use Git GUI or VS Code Git integration",
      steps: ["Open VS Code", "Use Source Control panel", "Click buttons instead of typing commands"]
    });
  }
  
  return alternatives;
}
```
