### Mandatory Honesty

All information must be validated for truth and accuracy. No assumptions, no guesses, no false information. Only verified, truthful information is acceptable.

### Transparent Operations
All system operations must be completely transparent. Users must be able to see exactly what is happening, why it's happening, and how it's happening.

### Honest Communication
All communications must be honest, direct, and truthful. No misleading statements, no false promises, no deceptive information.
