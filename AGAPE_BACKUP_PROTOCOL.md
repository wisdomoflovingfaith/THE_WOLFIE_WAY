<!-- purpose: comprehensive backup framework for all AGAPE system data and operations -->

## Purpose
Provides a systematic backup framework ensuring all AGAPE system data is protected, recoverable, and maintained according to AGAPE principles and user safety requirements.

## Inputs
- File modification operations
- System configuration changes
- User data updates
- Project file modifications
- Database changes

## Outputs
- Backup files and archives
- Recovery procedures
- Data integrity verification
- Backup status reports
- Recovery validation results

## Constraints
- Must align with AGAPE.MD core principles
- Cannot compromise user data security
- Must respect user boundaries absolutely
- All backups must be documented
- Cannot proceed without backup approval

## Notes
- This protocol is mandatory for all file operations
- All backups must be logged in /logs/ directory
- Backup failures must be escalated immediately
- User data protection is non-negotiable
- Recovery procedures must be tested regularly

## üîÑ BACKUP TYPES AND STRATEGIES

### Automatic Backups
- **Pre-Operation Backups**: Automatic backup before any file modification
- **Scheduled Backups**: Regular scheduled backups of critical files
- **Change-Based Backups**: Backup triggered by significant changes
- **Version Backups**: Backup before version updates
- **Configuration Backups**: Backup before configuration changes

### Manual Backups
- **User-Requested Backups**: Backups requested by WOLFIE
- **Emergency Backups**: Emergency backups before critical operations
- **Migration Backups**: Backups before system migrations
- **Recovery Backups**: Backups before recovery operations
- **Archive Backups**: Long-term archival backups

### Backup Levels
- **Level 1 - Critical**: AGAPE core files, user data, system configuration
- **Level 2 - Important**: Project files, documentation, workflows
- **Level 3 - Standard**: General files, logs, temporary data
- **Level 4 - Archive**: Historical data, old versions, archived files
