## üèõÔ∏è AGAPE System Hierarchy

### The Clear Structure
```
AGAPE.MD (ROOT PARENT - The Prime Directive)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WHO.md (CHILD - WOLFIE Profile)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WHAT.md (CHILD - System Components)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WHERE.md (CHILD - Location & Context)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WHEN.md (CHILD - Timeline)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WHY.md (CHILD - Philosophy)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HOW.md (CHILD - Implementation)
```

## üìã File Relationships Explained

### AGAPE.MD - The Root Parent
- **Role**: The Prime Directive (unconditional love)
- **Status**: ROOT PARENT - No parent above this
- **Function**: Defines the highest principle for all systems
- **Children**: All other files derive from AGAPE principles

### WHO.md - WOLFIE Profile
- **Parent**: AGAPE.MD
- **Role**: User profile and identity
- **Function**: Defines boundaries, skills, and innovation patterns
- **Authority**: Validated by AGAPE principles

### WHAT.md - System Components
- **Parent**: AGAPE.MD
- **Role**: System components and projects
- **Function**: Documents all technical implementations
- **Authority**: Validated by AGAPE principles

### WHERE.md - Location & Context
- **Parent**: AGAPE.MD
- **Role**: Location and context documentation
- **Function**: Documents where the system operates
- **Authority**: Validated by AGAPE principles

### WHEN.md - Timeline
- **Parent**: AGAPE.MD
- **Role**: Development timeline and history
- **Function**: Tracks milestones and achievements
- **Authority**: Validated by AGAPE principles

### WHY.md - Philosophy
- **Parent**: AGAPE.MD
- **Role**: Purpose and philosophy
- **Function**: Explains the reasoning behind everything
- **Authority**: Validated by AGAPE principles

### HOW.md - Implementation
- **Parent**: AGAPE.MD
- **Role**: Implementation methodology
- **Function**: Practical guidance for using the system
- **Authority**: Validated by AGAPE principles

## üîÑ Authority Flow

### Decision Making Process
1. **AGAPE.MD** - Provides the principles (unconditional love)
2. **Core Files** - All decisions based on AGAPE principles
3. **Validation** - All operations validated against AGAPE principles

### Validation Process
1. **Check AGAPE**: Does this align with unconditional love?
2. **Check Core File**: Does the specific file (WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY, HOW) support this?
3. **Check Integration**: Does this integrate properly with other core files?

## üö® Common Confusion Points

### "Is AGAPE the parent of WHO?"
**YES** - AGAPE.MD is the parent of WHO.md

### "What's the hierarchy?"
**AGAPE.MD** (parent) ‚Üí **WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY, HOW** (children)

### "Who makes the decisions?"
**AGAPE.MD** provides principles, **Core Files** make decisions based on AGAPE principles

### "How many core files?"
**7 Total**: AGAPE.md + WHO.md + WHAT.md + WHERE.md + WHEN.md + WHY.md + HOW.md

## ‚úÖ Clear Rules

### File Creation Rules
1. **All files** must be children of AGAPE.MD
2. **All operations** must align with AGAPE principles
3. **All decisions** must serve unconditional love

### Core File Rules
1. **AGAPE.MD** - Sets the principles (unconditional love)
2. **Core Files** - Make decisions based on AGAPE principles
3. **Integration** - All files work together harmoniously

### Validation Rules
1. **AGAPE Check** - Does this serve unconditional love?
2. **Core File Check** - Does the specific file support this?
3. **Integration Check** - Does this work with other core files?
