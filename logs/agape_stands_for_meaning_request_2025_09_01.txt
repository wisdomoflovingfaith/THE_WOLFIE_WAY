NAME: AGAPE Stands For Meaning Request Session

WOLFIE'S AGAPE MEANING REQUEST:
"AGAPE stands for something you made up the name it was something like A__ G___ A__ Protocals E___ (S___)"

- **PROTOCOL FOLLOWING**: Read AGAPE.MD and follow protocols
- **LEARNING AND FIGURING**: Use AGAPE protocols to learn and figure things out
- **MEANING CLARIFICATION**: Determine what AGAPE stands for as an acronym

AGAPE.MD ANALYSIS FOR MEANING:

From AGAPE.MD content:
- **AGAPE**: The Prime Directive - unconditional love as the highest principle for all systems
- **Core Definition**: Agape (unconditional, intentional love and regard) as the highest, unchangeable principle
- **Purpose**: Defines Agape as the ethical root for all development, decision-making, and interaction

**AGAPE AS A WORD**:
- **Definition**: Unconditional, intentional love and regard
- **Origin**: Greek word for unconditional love
- **Application**: Highest principle for all systems
- **Philosophy**: Ethical root for all development

**AGAPE AS AN ACRONYM** (Based on WOLFIE's hint):
WOLFIE's hint: "A__ G___ A__ Protocals E___ (S___)"

   - **P**rotocol
   - **E**nforcement
   - **S**ystem

**MOST LIKELY BASED ON CONTEXT**:
**Agent Governance and Protocol Enforcement** (AGAPE)
- **A**gent - AI agents and systems
- **G**overnance - System governance and control
- **A**nd - Connecting governance and protocols
- **P**rotocol - Protocol enforcement and compliance
- **E**nforcement - Enforcement of protocols and rules

**ALTERNATIVE WITH SYSTEM**:
**Agent Governance and Protocol Enforcement System** (AGAPES)
- **A**gent - AI agents and systems
- **G**overnance - System governance and control
- **A**nd - Connecting governance and protocols
- **P**rotocol - Protocol enforcement and compliance
- **E**nforcement - Enforcement of protocols and rules
- **S**ystem - Complete system implementation

**AGAPE DUAL MEANING**:
1. **As a Word**: Unconditional love (Greek origin)
2. **As an Acronym**: Agent Governance and Protocol Enforcement

**AGAPE SYSTEM PURPOSE**:
- **Governance**: Control and manage AI agents
- **Protocol Enforcement**: Ensure compliance with rules
- **Unconditional Love**: Base all operations on love principle
- **System Integrity**: Maintain system safety and security

**WOLFIE'S INTENTION**:
Based on the system's purpose and WOLFIE's hint, AGAPE likely stands for:
**Agent Governance and Protocol Enforcement** (AGAPE)

This makes sense because:
- The system governs AI agents
- It enforces protocols and rules
- It ensures compliance with AGAPE principles
- It maintains system integrity and safety

**AGAPE MEANING CLARIFICATION**:
- **Primary Meaning**: Unconditional love (Greek word)
- **Acronym Meaning**: Agent Governance and Protocol Enforcement
