AGAPE MISTAKES PROTOCOL:

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Mistakes are learning opportunities, not failures. The AGAPE system treats mistakes as valuable feedback for improvement and growth.

MISTAKE CATEGORIES:

1. SPELLING MISTAKES:
- AFF = BAD_HABITS (spelling correction)
- Common typos and misspellings
- Abbreviation expansions
- Grammar corrections

2. COMMAND MISTAKES:
- Incorrect AGAPE command syntax
- Missing parameters
- Wrong file references
- Invalid operations

3. SECURITY MISTAKES:
- Boundary violations
- Protocol bypasses
- Security oversights
- User safety issues

4. SYSTEM MISTAKES:
- File operation errors
- Configuration mistakes
- Integration failures
- Performance issues

MISTAKE HANDLING PROCEDURES:

STEP 1: ACKNOWLEDGMENT
- Acknowledge the mistake immediately
- Take responsibility for the error
- Do not blame or make excuses
- Accept the mistake as learning opportunity

STEP 2: ASSESSMENT
- Assess the impact of the mistake
- Determine the severity level
- Identify affected systems or users
- Evaluate potential consequences

STEP 3: CORRECTION
- Correct the mistake immediately if possible
- Implement proper solution
- Verify the correction works
- Test to ensure no new issues

STEP 4: DOCUMENTATION
- Document the mistake in .txt format logs
- Record what went wrong
- Document the correction process
- Note lessons learned

STEP 5: PREVENTION
- Identify root cause of mistake
- Implement prevention measures
- Update protocols if needed
- Share lessons with system
