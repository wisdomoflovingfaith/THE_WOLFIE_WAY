### **Standard Checkpoint - MEDIUM RISK**

```
AGAPE VALIDATION CHECKPOINT - MEDIUM RISK
=========================================

Date: [DATE]
Time: [TIME]
User: [USER]
Operation: [OPERATION_DESCRIPTION]
Risk Level: MEDIUM

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH RISK OPERATION TEMPLATE

### **Comprehensive Checkpoint - HIGH RISK**

Use the full AGAPE Validation Protocol as documented in `AGAPE_VALIDATION_PROTOCOL.md`.

## üéØ VALIDATION DECISION MATRIX

### **Risk Assessment Criteria**

| Operation Type | Terminal Commands | File Modifications | Network Access | User Data | Risk Level |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Read-only Display | No | No | No | No | LOW |
| Configuration Read | No | No | No | No | LOW |
| Simple Calculation | No | No | No | No | LOW |
| File Creation | No | Yes | No | No | MEDIUM |
| Database Query | No | No | Yes | No | MEDIUM |
| User Input Process | No | No | No | Yes | MEDIUM |
| System Config Change | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | HIGH |
| Network Operations | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | HIGH |
| Security Operations | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | HIGH |

### **Template Selection Guide**

- **LOW RISK**: Use streamlined template (3 essential checks)
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Use standard template (AGAPE + Security checks)
- **HIGH RISK**: Use comprehensive template (Full protocol)

## üîÑ VALIDATION WORKFLOW

### **Automated Risk Assessment**

```bash
# Function to determine risk level
assess_risk_level() {
    local operation="$1"
    local risk_level="LOW"
    
    # Check for high-risk indicators
    if echo "$operation" | grep -qi "terminal\|command\|rm\|del\|format\|network\|security"; then
        risk_level="HIGH"
    elif echo "$operation" | grep -qi "file.*modif\|database\|api\|user.*input"; then
        risk_level="MEDIUM"
    fi
    
    echo "$risk_level"
}

# Usage
RISK_LEVEL=$(assess_risk_level "$OPERATION_DESCRIPTION")
echo "Risk Level: $RISK_LEVEL"
```

### **Template Selection Logic**

```bash
case $RISK_LEVEL in
    "LOW")
        use_streamlined_template
        ;;
    "MEDIUM")
        use_standard_template
        ;;
    "HIGH")
        use_comprehensive_template
        ;;
esac
```
